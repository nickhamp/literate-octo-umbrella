This is my first project on GitHub. I'm attempting to build a blog site for Disney Vacations over at disneyknowhow.com and want to include some features to help people maximize their Disney Experiences. My first goal is to build a crowd calendar that I can share on this website and then I would like to build a recommendation algorithm for visitors.
