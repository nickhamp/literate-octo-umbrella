This is my first project on GitHub. I'm attempting to build a blog site for Disney Vacations over at disneyknowhow.com and want to include some features to help people maximize their Disney Experiences.

My first goal is to build a crowd calendar that I can share on the website and then I would like to build a recommendation algorithm for visitors that utilizes their user preferences, crowd data, wait times, and location to help them determine what to do next while they're at Disney World.

This is a learning experience and this code will be something that I am not sure will actually ever see reality.
